                <p> This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things.I'll be sure to use the 
                <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language" >HTML</abbr>  tags I've been learning how to code.</p>

                <p>This is another paragraph, and I would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King, Jr. who once said
                <q> I have a dream</q>.</p>

                        The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort 
                        and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy</p>

                        Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle.</p>
